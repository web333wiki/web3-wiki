# Web3 Wiki

> [!note]
> This wiki leverages [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to create a comprehensive knowledge graph for your benefit.

Welcome to the [Web3 Wiki](https://web3-wiki.org/), a collaborative space for the Web3 community to gather and share knowledge about Web3 technologies.

The wiki is organized into thousands of cards, each representing an independent knowledge unit that links to other cards. There are three types of cards in this wiki:

- `explain-card`: Provides explanations of concepts, technologies, or protocols (e.g., [Hard fork](https://web3-wiki.org/cards/Hard+fork), [Rollup](https://web3-wiki.org/cards/Rollup)).
- `show-card`: Highlights projects, tools, or services (e.g., [Ethereum](https://web3-wiki.org/cards/Ethereum), [Etherscan](https://web3-wiki.org/cards/Etherscan)).
- `awesome-card`: Curates collections of excellent resources (e.g., [Awesome Ethereum](https://web3-wiki.org/cards/Awesome+Ethereum)).
