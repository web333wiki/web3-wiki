"Ask Me Anything" (AMA) sessions are designed to encourage people to ask questions. These sessions engage the community and provide answers to their inquiries. AMAs can be conducted through various platforms, including social media, blog posts, or live events. The primary goal is to foster dialogue and share information on specific topics of interest.
