In the context of blockchain, a system is Turing-complete if it can perform any computation that a Turing machine can. Ethereum is Turing-complete, meaning it can execute any computation via [[Smart contract]]s, within the limits imposed by the [[Gas]] mechanism. This capability allows developers to create decentralized applications ([[DApp]]) that can perform complex operations, making [[Ethereum]] a versatile platform for innovation in the blockchain space.
