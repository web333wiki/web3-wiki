A seed phrase is a series of words generated by your cryptocurrency wallet that gives you access to the crypto associated with that wallet. It is a crucial component of wallet security, as it allows you to recover your funds if you lose access to your wallet. The seed phrase should be kept secure and private, as anyone with access to it can control the associated funds.
