Know Your Customer (KYC) is a set of guidelines and rules used by financial and investment institutions to ensure they are doing business with individuals who are who they claim to be. Typically, the KYC process requires the individual to provide a government-issued ID, such as a driver's license or passport, as well as proof of address, such as a utility bill or bank statement. It is used to verify the identity of the customer and to ensure they are not involved in any illegal activities, especially money laundering.
