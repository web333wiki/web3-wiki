A faucet is a token distribution system in the cryptocurrency space that distributes small amounts of digital assets to users for rewarding participation or testing purposes. Faucets are commonly used by cryptocurrency projects to distribute tokens to users, promote adoption, and incentivize engagement with their platform. Users can claim tokens from a faucet by completing simple tasks, such as solving captchas, watching ads, or participating in surveys.
