## Introduction

[Pi Network](https://minepi.com/blog/) is a digital currency project aimed at making cryptocurrency mining accessible to everyday users through mobile phones. Founded in 2018 by Stanford graduates, the project seeks to distribute cryptocurrency fairly and build a decentralized marketplace and ecosystem for its users.

## Service Provided

Pi Network provides a mobile-first cryptocurrency mining experience that consumes minimal battery power and processing resources. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that require significant computing power to mine, Pi can be mined through a mobile app by tapping a button once every 24 hours. This approach makes cryptocurrency accessible to the general public without specialized equipment or technical knowledge.

## Technical Details

The Pi Network operates on a consensus algorithm called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which is more energy-efficient than traditional Proof of Work systems. Pi uses a security circle concept where users build trust networks that contribute to the overall security of the blockchain.
## Team

The Pi Network was founded by a team of Stanford graduates:
- Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis - Head of Technology
- Dr. Chengdiao Fan - Head of Product
- Vincent McPhillip - Head of Community

## Roadmap

Pi Network follows a three-phase development roadmap:

- Phase 1 (Beta): Launched in March 2019, allowing users to mine Pi on mobile devices
- Phase 2 (Testnet): Launched in March 2020, testing the Pi blockchain
- Phase 3 (Mainnet): Transition to a fully decentralized blockchain with KYC verification requirements and open ecosystem development
