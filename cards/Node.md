In cryptocurrency networks, a node is any computer that connects to the blockchain network. Nodes play a crucial role in validating transactions, maintaining the blockchain ledger, and ensuring the network's security and decentralization.

Types of Nodes:

- Full Nodes: Store the entire history of the blockchain and independently verify every transaction.
- Light Nodes: Download only a portion of the blockchain and rely on full nodes for transaction verification.
- Mining Nodes: Validate and record new transactions on the blockchain through the mining process.
