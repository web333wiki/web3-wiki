An [Externally Owned Account](https://ethereum.org/en/accounts/) (EOA) is a type of account in blockchain networks, particularly [[Ethereum]], that is controlled by a [[Private key]] held by an individual or entity. EOAs can initiate transactions, send and receive cryptocurrency, and interact with smart contracts. Unlike contract accounts, EOAs are not governed by code and require manual signing of transactions.
