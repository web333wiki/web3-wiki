CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based game that allows players to collect, breed, and trade virtual cats. Each CryptoKitty is a unique non-fungible token ([[NFT]]) stored on the [[Ethereum]] blockchain, making them rare and collectible. The game was developed by Axiom Zen and launched in November 2017. Since then, CryptoKitties has gained popularity and has become a significant use case for NFTs and blockchain technology.
