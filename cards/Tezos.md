## Project Overview

Tezos is an open-source, decentralized blockchain network that can evolve by upgrading itself through a formal on-chain governance mechanism. It aims to offer security and correctness for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its native cryptocurrency is tez (XTZ).

The core purpose of Tezos is to create a blockchain that can be upgraded without the need for hard forks, which can divide a community. Key features include its self-amendment process, Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) consensus, formal verification for smart contracts (using Michelson language), and a strong focus on community governance.

## Technical Details

- **Underlying Technology:** Tezos employs a Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) consensus mechanism. Token holders can delegate their staking rights to "bakers" (validators) without transferring ownership of their tokens.
- **Architecture Overview:** Tezos has a modular architecture consisting of a network shell (handling peer-to-peer communication, consensus) and a protocol (defining the transaction types, governance mechanism). The protocol can be amended by token holder votes.
- **Unique Selling Points:**
  - **Self-Amendment:** Tezos can upgrade its own protocol through a formal, on-chain voting process, allowing it to evolve and adopt new technologies without hard forks.
  - **On-Chain Governance:** Token holders have direct control over the network's evolution.
  - **Formal Verification:** The smart contract language, Michelson, is designed to facilitate formal verification, enhancing security for complex dApps.
  - **Secure and Scalable:** Designed for high-value financial applications and other use cases requiring robust security.

## Use Cases

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Tezos hosts various DeFi applications, including decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and stablecoins.
- **NFTs and Digital Collectibles:** A growing ecosystem for artists and creators to mint and trade NFTs, with a focus on art and collectibles.
- **Institutional Use Cases:** Its security features and formal verification capabilities make it attractive for institutional applications, including tokenized assets and regulated financial products.
- **Voting and Governance Solutions:** The on-chain governance mechanism itself serves as a use case for decentralized decision-making.

## Getting Started

- **How to use/access:** Users can interact with Tezos using wallets like Kukai Wallet, Temple Wallet, or hardware wallets. XTZ can be acquired from major exchanges.
