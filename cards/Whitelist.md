In the crypto field, a whitelist refers to a list of participants allowed to join an event, such as an initial coin offering ([[ICO]]) or [[NFT]] mint. To join the whitelist, participants often need to complete a [[KYC]] process or hold a certain amount of tokens.

Getting onto a whitelist is seen as a reward for early supporters of a project, giving them the chance to participate before the general public. This benefits both the project and the participants, as it helps build a community of dedicated supporters and provides participants with exclusive opportunities to purchase tokens or NFTs at a discounted price before a public sale.
