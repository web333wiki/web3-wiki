A hard fork is opposite of a [[Soft fork]]. 

A hard fork is a forced bifurcation of a blockchain, usually implemented when a significant change is made to the network's software code. It results in a permanent divergence of the blockchain into two separate blockchains. The original blockchain does not recognize the new version. 

An well-known hard fork happened in the [[Ethereum]] network in 2016 after [The DAO Hack](https://cryptodose.net/learn/the-dao-hack/).
