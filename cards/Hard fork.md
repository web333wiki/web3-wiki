A hard fork is a forced bifurcation of a blockchain, usually implemented when a significant change is made to the network's software code. It results in a permanent divergence of the blockchain into two separate blockchains. The original blockchain does not recognize the new version. An example of a hard fork is the [[Ethereum]] hard fork that occurred in 2016 after the DAO hack.
