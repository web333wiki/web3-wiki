## Introduction & Definition

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus mechanism used by blockchain networks to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike [[Proof of work]] (PoW) systems that require miners to perform intensive computational work, PoS systems select validators to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" or lock up as collateral. This staked amount acts as a security deposit; validators risk losing their stake if they act dishonestly or negligently.

### Analogy/ELI5

Imagine a shareholder meeting for a company. In a PoS system, the more shares (coins) you own and are willing to commit (stake), the more likely you are to be chosen to make decisions (validate blocks) for the company (the network). If you make good decisions, you get rewarded (transaction fees and new coins). If you try to cheat or harm the company, you risk losing your shares (your staked coins). This is much more energy-efficient than a system where everyone has to shout the loudest (do a lot of computational work) to be heard.

### Importance & Purpose

Proof of Stake is important in the Web3 space primarily because it offers a more energy-efficient and potentially more scalable alternative to [[Proof of work]]. Its purpose is to secure the blockchain, validate transactions, and create new blocks, ensuring the integrity and continuity of the network. PoS aims to lower the barrier to entry for network participation, as it doesn't require specialized, high-powered mining hardware, theoretically allowing more users to contribute to network security and governance.

### Historical Context & Evolution

The concept of Proof of Stake was first discussed in 2011 on the Bitcointalk forum as a solution to the high energy consumption and potential centralization issues of [[Proof of work]]. Peercoin, launched in 2012, was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement a PoS system. Since then, PoS has evolved significantly, with numerous variations and improvements developed. Many newer blockchains have launched with PoS from the outset, and some established PoW chains, most notably [[Ethereum]], have transitioned or are in the process of transitioning to PoS to leverage its benefits.

## Core Principles & Detailed Mechanism

### Key Components/Elements

- Validators: These are participants in the network who have locked up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (their "stake") to be eligible to create new blocks and validate transactions.
- Staked Coins: The amount of cryptocurrency a validator commits to the network. This stake acts as collateral, incentivizing honest behavior.
- Block Proposers: Validators chosen by the protocol to create a new block of transactions.
- Block Attesters/Validators: Other validators who check the proposed block's validity and attest to it.
- Rewards: Incentives, typically in the form of newly minted coins and/or transaction fees, distributed to validators for successfully proposing and validating blocks.
- Slashing: A penalty mechanism where validators lose a portion (or all) of their staked coins if they act maliciously (e.g., try to double-spend or validate fraudulent transactions) or are offline too often.

### In-depth Mechanism/How it Works

1.  Staking: Users who want to participate as validators lock up a specific amount of the network's native cryptocurrency. This process is called staking.
2.  Validator Selection: The PoS protocol selects a validator to propose the next block. The selection process can vary significantly between different PoS implementations. Common methods include:
    - Randomized Block Selection: Validators are chosen randomly, but the probability of being selected is often proportional to the size of their stake (e.g., more stake means a higher chance).
    - Coin Age Selection: Considers how long the coins have been staked. Older coins might have a higher chance, though systems often reset coin age after block creation to prevent hoarding.
    - Other algorithm-specific criteria.
3.  Block Creation: The selected validator creates a new block by bundling transactions from the transaction pool, validating them, and signing the block with their private key.
4.  Block Attestation/Validation: Other validators in the network then check the proposed block. If they agree it's valid, they "attest" to it. A block typically needs a certain number of attestations to be considered confirmed.
5.  Reward Distribution: Once a block is successfully added to the blockchain, the proposing validator and sometimes attesting validators receive rewards.
6.  Slashing (if necessary): If a validator attempts to cheat the system or fails to perform their duties correctly (e.g., by being offline for extended periods), the protocol can automatically "slash" a portion of their staked coins, which are then often burned or redistributed.

### Underlying Technical Details

One of the critical challenges in early PoS designs was the "nothing at stake" problem. This refers to a scenario where, if a blockchain forks into two competing chains, validators have an incentive to validate blocks on both forks because it costs them nothing extra to do so, potentially hindering consensus. Modern PoS systems like [[Ethereum]]'s Casper implement mechanisms like slashing to heavily penalize validators for such behavior, effectively creating a significant "something at stake."

### Variations, Types, or Implementations

PoS is not a monolithic concept; several variations exist, each with different mechanisms for validator selection and reward distribution:

- Pure Proof of Stake: Validators directly stake their own coins.
- Delegated proof of stake (DPoS): Coin holders vote for a limited number of "delegates" or "witnesses" who are responsible for validating transactions and creating blocks. Examples include EOS, Tron, and Lisk.
- Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS): Implemented by networks like [[Polkadot]] and Kusama. Nominators (coin holders) select and back a set of validators with their own stake. Both nominators and validators share in the rewards and risks (slashing).
- Liquid Staking: Solutions that allow stakers to receive a tradable token representing their staked assets, providing liquidity while their original assets remain locked.
- Hybrid PoS/PoW: Some early systems combined elements of both consensus mechanisms.

[[Ethereum]]'s transition to PoS, known as "The Merge," implemented a version called Gasper, which combines Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) for finality and LMD-GHOST (Latest Message Driven Greediest Heaviest Observed SubTree) for fork choice.

## Practical Applications, Use Cases & Implications

### Concrete Examples & Real-World Applications

- Securing Blockchain Networks: PoS is the consensus mechanism behind many prominent blockchains, including [[Ethereum]] (post-Merge), Cardano, [[Solana]], [[Polkadot]], [[Tezos]], and Algorand.
- Staking for Passive Income: Coin holders can stake their assets directly or through staking pools/platforms to earn rewards, providing a form of passive income.
- Decentralized Governance: In some PoS networks, stake ownership can also translate to voting power in on-chain governance proposals, influencing the future development of the protocol.

### Benefits & Advantages

- Energy Efficiency: PoS consumes significantly less energy than PoW because it doesn't rely on intensive computations. This makes it a more environmentally friendly option.
- Lower Barrier to Entry for Validators: While requiring a capital investment (the stake), PoS generally doesn't demand expensive, specialized hardware like ASICs, potentially making participation more accessible.
- Reduced Centralization Risk from Hardware: The absence of reliance on specialized mining hardware reduces the risk of centralization seen in PoW mining pools dominated by entities with access to cheaper electricity and hardware.
- Economic Security: Validators are directly incentivized to act honestly because their own funds are staked as collateral. Malicious actions lead to the loss of this stake.
- Scalability Potential: Some argue PoS can offer better transaction throughput and scalability, though this is also dependent on other network design factors.

### Limitations, Challenges & Criticisms

- "Rich Get Richer" (Wealth Concentration): Validators with larger stakes tend to earn more rewards, potentially leading to an increasing concentration of wealth and influence within the network.
- Nothing at Stake Problem: As mentioned, older or poorly designed PoS systems could suffer from this, though modern implementations have robust solutions.
- Initial Coin Distribution: The fairness and decentralization of the initial coin distribution are crucial. If a few entities hold a majority of the coins at launch, they can dominate the network from the start.
- Subjectivity and Long-Range Attacks: Certain types of attacks or consensus failures in some PoS models might require more complex social coordination or subjective checkpoints to resolve, compared to PoW's objective longest-chain rule.
- Validator Collusion/Censorship: A cartel of large stakers could potentially collude to censor transactions or manipulate the blockchain.
- Complexity: Designing and implementing a secure and robust PoS system can be more complex than PoW.
- Liquidity Lock-up: Staked assets are typically locked for a period, reducing their liquidity, although solutions like liquid staking aim to mitigate this.
