## Overview

Arbitrum is a leading Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution for Ethereum, developed by Offchain Labs. It aims to provide faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to the Ethereum mainnet while inheriting its security. Arbitrum utilizes Optimistic Rollup technology and supports a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps).

- **Problem Solved:** Addresses Ethereum's scalability limitations by processing transactions off-chain, reducing congestion and cost on the mainnet.
- **Value Proposition:** Offers high throughput, low transaction fees, EVM compatibility, and a robust developer and user ecosystem.
- **Official Website:** [https://arbitrum.io/](https://arbitrum.io/)
- **Status:** Live (Arbitrum One mainnet, Arbitrum Nova for ultra-low cost transactions).

## Key Features

- **Optimistic Rollups:** Assumes transactions are valid by default and uses a fraud-proving mechanism for challenges.
- **Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM):** While EVM compatible, it has its own execution environment designed for efficiency.
- **Arbitrum Orbit:** A framework allowing projects to launch their own customizable Layer 3 chains that settle to Arbitrum Layer 2s.
- **Stylus:** Enables smart contract development in multiple programming languages like Rust, C, and C++, in addition to Solidity, by compiling to WASM.
- **Separate Chains (e.g., Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova):** Offers different chains tailored for various use cases (e.g., Arbitrum One for DeFi and NFTs, Arbitrum Nova for gaming and social applications with an AnyTrust chain).

## Technology

- **Blockchain/Platform:** Layer 2 solution built on [[Ethereum]].
- **Architecture:** Sequencer batches transactions, posts data to Ethereum L1. Verifiers can challenge state via fraud proofs.
- **Core Mechanism:** Optimistic Rollup with advanced fraud-proving capabilities.

## Ecosystem & Use Cases

- **Target Audience:** Developers, DeFi users, NFT traders, gamers, and applications requiring high throughput.
- **How It's Used:** DeFi, NFTs, gaming, social applications, DAO governance.
- **Tokenomics (ARB Token):** The ARB token is used for governance of the Arbitrum DAO.

## Getting Started & Resources

- **Access:** Add Arbitrum One or Nova to EVM-compatible wallets; use bridges to transfer assets.
- **Documentation:** [https://developer.arbitrum.io/](https://developer.arbitrum.io/)
- **Community:** Active Discord, Twitter, and governance forum.
- **Bridge:** [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)
