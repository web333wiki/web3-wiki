## Introduction

Acala is developing the [[Liquidity]] layer for web3 finance, aiming to provide sustainable infrastructure for hybrid finance (HyFi) solutions that integrate decentralized finance ([[DeFI]]) and centralized finance (CeFi) with both crypto and real-world assets. Acala offers a Universal Asset Hub that supports multichain liquid staking token (LST) protocols (e.g., liquid DOT - LDOT), an AMM decentralized exchange, and a customizable, EVM-compatible app platform built on [[Substrate]]. Secured by [[Polkadot]], Acala serves as the liquidity gateway for Polkadot [[Parachain]]s and L1/L2 blockchains.

## Technology

Acala's technology integrates advanced components to create a versatile ecosystem. The Acala EVM ([[Ethereum Virtual Machine]]) allows developers to create, test, and deploy [[DApps]] using familiar tools like [[Remix]] and Waffle, ensuring seamless interaction with Acala nodes via the web3 provider bodhi.js.

The blockchain on which Acala Token operates, Polkadot, is designed to support multiple interconnected blockchains, known as parachains. This architecture enhances scalability and interoperability, allowing different blockchains to communicate and share information securely. As a key player in the Polkadot ecosystem, Acala builds partnerships with industry leaders early to drive innovation and growth. It also focuses on providing a liquidity gateway for Polkadot parachains and features an [[AMM]] decentralized exchange for seamless asset trading within the ecosystem.
