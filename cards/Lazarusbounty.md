# Lazarus Bounty

## Overview

[Lazarus Bounty](https://www.lazarusbounty.com/) is a collaborative program launched to counter North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus (also known as APT38 or HIDDEN COBRA), which has stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency assets often used to fund North Korea's weapons programs. The program incentivizes the identification and reporting of Lazarus-associated wallets through substantial financial rewards, with its importance highlighted by a recent incident [[ByBit's $1.4 Billon ETH Hack]] where approximately 1.4 billion ETH was stolen from Bybit in an attack believed to be linked to the group.

## Reward Structure

- The total bounty is 10% of the recovered funds, distributed as follows:
    - 5% to the entity that successfully froze the funds
    - 5% to contributors who helped trace the funds
- Bounties are awarded immediately once the funds are confirmed as frozen
- Rewards of up to $500,000 are available for high-quality intelligence that leads to the identification of Lazarus-controlled wallets or the recovery of stolen funds

## How to Participate

Participants can submit intelligence through the official website at [lazarusbounty.com](https://www.lazarusbounty.com/en/). All submissions are evaluated by experts, including former law enforcement officials specialized in cryptocurrency investigations.
