The Nakamoto Coefficient is a crucial metric for assessing the decentralization of a blockchain network. Named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, it is defined as the minimum number of nodes that must be compromised to gain control of the network.

A higher Nakamoto Coefficient indicates a more decentralized network. For instance, if a network has a Nakamoto Coefficient of 5, it means that at least 5 nodes would need to be compromised to control the network, censor transactions, or double-spend coins. 

To calculate the Nakamoto Coefficient, determine the minimum amount of mining or voting power required to control the network. Then, rank all entities in the network by their mining or voting power and sum the power until you reach the threshold. The number of entities at this point is the Nakamoto Coefficient.
