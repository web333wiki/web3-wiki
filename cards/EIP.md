An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) is a design document that provides information to the Ethereum community or describes a new feature for Ethereum or its processes. EIPs are used to propose standards and improvements to the Ethereum protocol, ensuring a consistent and collaborative development process.

There are three types of EIPs:

1. Standards Track: These EIPs propose changes to the network protocols, including consensus and networking layers.
2. Informational: These provide guidelines or information to the Ethereum community but do not propose new features.
3. Process: These describe changes to the processes surrounding Ethereum's development.

EIPs play a crucial role in fostering innovation and consensus within the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing developers and stakeholders to collaborate on the platform's evolution.
