ERC-721 is a standard interface for Non-Fungible Tokens ([[NFT]]s) on the [[Ethereum]] blockchain. It enables the creation, ownership, and transfer of unique digital assets, each with distinct properties and identifiers. Unlike fungible tokens, such as [[ERC-20]] tokens, each ERC-721 token is one-of-a-kind and cannot be directly exchanged on a one-to-one basis with another ERC-721 token. This standard facilitates the development of applications like digital art, collectibles, and virtual real estate, where the uniqueness of each asset is essential.
