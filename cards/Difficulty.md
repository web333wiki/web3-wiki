In the context of Bitcoin's proof-of-work system, difficulty refers to a measure of how challenging it is for miners to find a hash below a given target during the mining process. This difficulty level adjusts periodically based on the total hashing power (computing power) in the network to ensure that new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes.
