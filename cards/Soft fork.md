Due to the nature of blockchain technology, updates or changes on the chain must be agreed upon by all participating nodes. If some nodes do not agree with the changes, the network splits into two, each following different sets of rules. A soft fork refers to a fork where old nodes can still participate in the network. It's like a compatible upgrade. The new rules are a subset of the old rules. Because of this, a soft fork is usually used to implement new features or improvements to the network.

A well-known example of a soft fork in [[Bitcoin]] is Segregated Witness (SegWit).
