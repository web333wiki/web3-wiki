# Bybit's $1.4 Billion ETH Hack

## Overview

On Feb 21, 2025, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange Bybit suffered a massive security breach, resulting in the theft of approximately 410,000 ETH (worth $1.4 billion at the time). The attack was believed to be orchestrated by the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus. 

## What Happened

From the information provided by the Bybit team, the hackers seem to have exploited the Bybit multi-signature signer system and made a mocked UI to trick the signers into signing the transactions. These mocked UIs were designed to look like the real UI with correct addresses and safe URLs. The hackers then took control of the multi-signature ETH cold wallet and transferred the funds to their own wallet.
