A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of Internet traffic from multiple sources. This is typically achieved using a botnet, which is a network of compromised computers and devices controlled by an attacker.
