In cryptography, a nonce (number used once) refers to a value that is utilized only a single time. Similar to a nonce word—a term created for one occasion—a cryptographic nonce is typically a random or pseudo-random number employed in authentication protocols. Its purpose is to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks.
