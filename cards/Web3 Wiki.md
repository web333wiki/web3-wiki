## What is Web3 Wiki?

With the help of an AI assistant, mastering new concepts and technologies has never been easier. You can ask questions, get explanations, and receive recommendations on any topic of interest. However, I believe that connecting the knowledge you already have and building a network of understanding is even more valuable than simply learning isolated facts.

That’s why I built this wiki—a knowledge network for Web3. It covers topics ranging from basic to advanced levels. You can start from any point of interest and navigate to related topics, just like exploring a knowledge graph. I hope you find this wiki helpful every time you visit.

## Quick Start

The wiki is composed of thousands of cards, each representing a piece of knowledge, such as a concept explanation or a project analysis. You can search for any topic of interest using the search box in the top left corner.

There are three types of cards in this wiki:

| Card Type      | Description                                                                       |
| :------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `explain-card` | Explains a concept, technology, or protocol, such as [[Hard fork]] or [[Rollup]]. |
| `show-card`    | Showcases a project, tool, or service, such as [[Ethereum]] or [[Etherscan]].     |
| `awesome-card` | Collects awesome resources, such as [[Awesome ethereum]].                         |

You can click on a tag within a card to see all cards with the same tag. That’s all you need to know to start using this wiki.
