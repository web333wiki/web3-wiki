## Purpose

You can start from any point of interest and navigate to related topics, allowing you to learn quickly and deeply. We hope you find this wiki beneficial each time you visit.

## Quick Start

The wiki is composed of thousands of cards, each representing a piece of knowledge, such as a concept explanation or a project analysis. You can search for any topic of interest using the search box in the top left corner.

There are three types of cards in this wiki:

| Card Type      | Description                                                                       |
| :------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `explain-card` | Explains a concept, technology, or protocol, such as [[Hard fork]] or [[Rollup]]. |
| `show-card`    | Showcases a project, tool, or service, such as [[Solana]] or [[Etherscan]].       |
| `awesome-card` | Collects awesome resources, such as [[Awesome Ethereum]] or [[Awesome Polkadot]]. |

You can click on a tag within a card to see all cards with the same tag. That's all you need to know to start using this wiki.
