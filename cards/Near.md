**NEAR Protocol** is a sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain designed for high scalability, developer-friendliness, and usability. It aims to provide a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) that can operate at a global scale. More recently, NEAR has been emphasizing its capabilities for AI-native applications and cross-chain interoperability.

## Key Features

-   **Scalability (Nightshade Sharding):** NEAR uses a sharding mechanism called Nightshade, which splits the network into parallel processing units (shards). This allows the network to scale its transaction throughput capacidad as the number of users and applications grows.
-   **Developer-Friendly:** Supports development in familiar languages like JavaScript and Rust, lowering the barrier to entry for Web2 developers. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and documentation.
-   **AI-Native:** Positioned as "The Blockchain for AI," NEAR is building infrastructure to support AI-driven applications and AI agents managing assets and services autonomously.
-   **Cross-Chain Functionality:** Emphasizes chain abstraction to streamline cross-network execution and interoperability with other blockchains like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cosmos.
-   **User-Focused:** Aims to simplify the user experience in Web3, making it easier for mainstream users to interact with dApps.
-   **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** Utilizes a PoS consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient compared to Proof-of-Work.
-   **Carbon Neutral:** NEAR is a carbon-neutral blockchain.

## Ecosystem and Foundation

The **NEAR Foundation** is a non-profit organization based in Switzerland that supports the growth, development, and decentralization of the NEAR ecosystem through grant funding and other initiatives. The ecosystem includes a wide range of dApps, infrastructure projects, and developer communities.
