A Layer 2 (L2) network or solution operates on top of an existing [[Layer 1]] blockchain to improve its scalability and efficiency. The primary goal of Layer 2 solutions is to increase transaction throughput (transactions per second) and reduce transaction fees without compromising the security or decentralization of the main underlying Layer 1 network.

Layer 2 solutions achieve this by processing transactions off the main chain (off-chain), thereby alleviating congestion on the Layer 1. Periodically, these off-chain transactions are bundled and anchored back to the Layer 1 network, which ensures that they benefit from the security and finality of the base layer.

There are several types of Layer 2 scaling solutions, each with its own mechanisms and trade-offs. Some common approaches include:

- Rollups (e.g., Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups)
- State Channels
- Sidechains
- Plasma

These solutions aim to address the scalability challenges faced by many [[Layer 1]] blockchains, making decentralized applications more usable and cost-effective for a wider audience. By offloading transactional and computational load, Layer 2s enable blockchains to handle a much larger volume of activity.

Examples of Layer 2 solutions, particularly for [[Ethereum]], include:

- [[Arbitrum]]
- [[Optimism]]
- [[Polygon]] (which has various solutions, including a PoS sidechain and L2 technologies)
- [[ZKSync]]
