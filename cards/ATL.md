All-time low (ATL) refers to the lowest price a cryptocurrency has ever reached in its history. It is the opposite of all-time high ([[ATH]]) and signifies the worst performance of a cryptocurrency.

ATL is an essential metric for traders and investors to understand the price history of a cryptocurrency. By analyzing ATL, traders can identify potential buying opportunities, assess the risk associated with an asset, and make informed decisions about investing in a cryptocurrency.
