## Introduction

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/) is a decentralized voting system that allows projects to create and manage proposals off-chain, while still leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology. It is widely used in the decentralized finance ([[DeFI]]) and decentralized autonomous organization ([[DAO]]) ecosystems.

## Service Provided

Snapshot provides a lightweight, off-chain voting mechanism that enables projects to make decisions without incurring high transaction fees. It solves the problem of expensive on-chain governance by allowing votes to be cast off-chain and then verified on-chain. This brings value by making governance more accessible and cost-effective for projects of all sizes.

## Technical Details

Snapshot uses IPFS to store proposals and votes, ensuring data integrity and decentralization. It integrates with various blockchain networks to verify voter eligibility and tally votes. The system supports multiple voting strategies, including single-choice voting, weighted voting, and quadratic voting, providing flexibility for different governance models.
