## Introduction

Story is a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for intellectual property management. It tokenizes any type of IP - from ideas and images to real-world assets, songs, AI models, and NFTs - by embedding usage terms, attribution, and royalty agreements directly into the blockchain. Story provides a transparent, decentralized solution that enables IP holders to protect their work, collaborate seamlessly, and unlock revenue opportunities in an AI-powered economy. The protocol combines a 100% EVM-compatible blockchain with deep execution layer optimizations to handle complex IP data structures efficiently, while its Proof-of-Creativity Protocol and Programmable IP License system automate on-chain IP management and enforcement.

## Service Provided

### Layer 1 Blockchain

Story Network choose to build its own Layer 1 blockchain to innovate across the entire technical stack. This enables it to implement essential features like on-chain dispute resolution or on-chain IP graphs with precompiled contracts. 

### Programmable IP Layer

Story Network's Programmable IP Layer is a core component of the Story Protocol. It enables IP holders to encode IP rights, usage terms, and royalty structures directly into the blockchain. This allows for flexible IP management through smart contracts, automated enforcement of IP rights, transparent attribution of creative works, and dynamic revenue sharing models. At the heart of this system is the `IP Asset` and its associated `IP Account`, which is a smart contract account bound with `IP Asset` to manage
the IP related activities.
