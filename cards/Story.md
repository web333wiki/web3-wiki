## Introduction

Story is a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for intellectual property management. It tokenizes any type of IP - from ideas and images to real-world assets, songs, AI models, and NFTs - by embedding usage terms, attribution, and royalty agreements directly into the blockchain. Story provides a transparent, decentralized solution that enables IP holders to protect their work, collaborate seamlessly, and unlock revenue opportunities in an AI-powered economy. The protocol combines a 100% EVM-compatible blockchain with deep execution layer optimizations to handle complex IP data structures efficiently, while its Proof-of-Creativity Protocol and Programmable IP License system automate on-chain IP management and enforcement.
