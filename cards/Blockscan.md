## Introduction

[[Blockscan]] ([blockscan.com](https://blockscan.com/)) is a multi-chain explorer service developed and provided by the team behind the popular [[Ethereum]] explorer, [[Etherscan]]. It aims to offer a unified and user-friendly interface for users to explore, search, and analyze data across various blockchain networks. Beyond exploration, Blockscan also integrates features for portfolio tracking and secure messaging between Web3 addresses.

## Key Features

Blockscan offers a suite of features designed to cater to the needs of users interacting with multiple blockchains:

- **Multi-Chain Exploration**: Users can seamlessly switch between different supported blockchains to view blocks, transactions, addresses, and other on-chain data.
- **Unified Interface**: Provides a consistent user experience for exploring diverse blockchain ecosystems, reducing the learning curve associated with using multiple single-chain explorers.
- **Transaction Tracking**: Allows users to search for and track the status of their transactions across supported networks.
- **Address Monitoring**: Users can look up wallet addresses to view balances, token holdings, and transaction histories.
- **Portfolio Management**: Offers tools to track digital asset portfolios across different chains from a single dashboard.
- **Blockscan Chat**: A notable feature that enables users to send and receive messages directly between Web3 addresses, facilitating wallet-to-wallet communication. This can be useful for various purposes, including contacting an address owner regarding a transaction or an NFT.
- **Real-Time Data**: Aims to provide up-to-date information on blockchain activity.
- **Mobile Applications**: Blockscan also offers mobile apps for both iOS and Android, extending its functionality to users on the go.

## Supported Blockchains

Blockscan supports a growing number of blockchain networks. While the exact list can evolve, it is designed to cover many popular and emerging blockchains. Users should refer to the official [Blockscan website](https://blockscan.com/) for the most current list of supported chains. The service leverages the expertise of the [[Etherscan]] team to provide robust exploration capabilities for these networks.

Historically, services from the [[Etherscan]] team have provided exploration for dozens of chains, and Blockscan aims to consolidate this under one platform.

## Relationship with Etherscan

Blockscan is a distinct service but shares its heritage and development team with [[Etherscan]]. While [[Etherscan]] remains the premier explorer for [[Ethereum]] and EVM-compatible chains on an individual basis (often through its Explorer-as-a-Service model), Blockscan provides a broader, aggregated view across multiple, potentially non-EVM chains as well, along with its unique chat and portfolio features.
