# Show Card Rule

## Key Content Considerations

When creating or updating a `show-card`, ensure the following aspects are covered. The AI assistant should generate a logical content outline based on these key elements and the specific nature of the project/tool/service being showcased.

**1. Overview:**
    - Concise summary of the project/tool/service (1-2 sentences).
    - Problem Solved: The issue it addresses in Web3.
    - Value Proposition: Its unique benefit or advantage.
    - Official Website: Link to the official site.
    - Status (e.g., Live, Beta, In Development, key dates).

**2. Key Features:**
    - Main functionalities or capabilities, with brief explanations of each and their benefits.

**3. Technology:**
    - Blockchain/Platform (e.g., [[Ethereum]], [[Solana]], Standalone).
    - Architecture: High-level technical design/components.
    - Core Mechanism: Key technical innovation or process.
    - Smart Contracts: Links to relevant contracts (optional, mention audited contracts).

**4. Ecosystem & Use Cases:**
    - Target Audience (e.g., Developers, DeFi Traders, NFT Collectors).
    - How it's Used: Specific examples of interaction.
    - Integrations: Notable projects/platforms it integrates with.
    - Tokenomics (if applicable): Native token's utility, supply, distribution (link to `[[Token Name]]` card).

**5. Getting Started & Resources:**
    - Accessing: How to start using it (e.g., web app, download, API signup).
    - Documentation: Link to official documentation.
    - Community: Link to Discord/Telegram/Forum.
    - Support: Link to support channel/FAQ.
    - Source Code: Link to GitHub/GitLab (if open source).

**6. Related Concepts:**
    - Links to relevant `explain-card`s (underlying technologies, e.g., Built using [[Optimistic Rollups]]).
    - Links to relevant `awesome-card`s (e.g., See [[Awesome DeFi Tools]]).

## General Guidelines Adherence

- **All formatting, linking, naming, and file location MUST adhere to the standards defined in the [`wiki-guide.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).** This includes using H2 for sections, prioritizing official external links, using appropriate internal links, balancing prose and lists, and placing the file in the `cards` directory.
- The card **MUST** start with the `#show-card` tag on the very first line.


> **Process and quality standards:**
> All content creation and review for show-cards must follow the 'Content Creation Checklist' and 'Final Review Checklist' sections in the [wiki-guide.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).
