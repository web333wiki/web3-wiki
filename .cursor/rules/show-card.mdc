# Show Card Rule

## Key Content Considerations

When creating or updating a `show-card`, ensure the following aspects are covered. The AI assistant should generate a logical content outline based on these key elements and the specific nature of the project/tool/service being showcased.

**1. Overview:**
    - Comprehensive summary of the project/tool/service, going beyond a brief introduction. Explain its purpose and significance in the Web3 space.
    - Problem Solved: Clearly articulate the specific problem(s) it addresses within the Web3 ecosystem and detail *how* the project aims to solve them.
    - Value Proposition: Elaborate on its unique benefits, advantages, and differentiators. If possible, provide context or comparison against existing solutions.
    - Official Website: Link to the official site.
    - Status & Roadmap: Current development status (e.g., Live, Beta, In Development). Include key historical dates/milestones and an overview of the public roadmap or future plans.

**2. Key Features:**
    - Main functionalities or capabilities. For each feature, provide a **detailed explanation** of what it does, *how it works* from a user perspective, and its specific benefits and potential use cases. Ensure this section is comprehensive and informative, reflecting deep knowledge.

**3. Technology:**
    - Blockchain/Platform: Specify the underlying blockchain(s) or platform(s) it is built on or interacts with (e.g., [[Ethereum]], [[Solana]], Standalone).
    - Architecture: Provide a detailed explanation of the high-level technical design, its core components, and their interactions. Diagrams are encouraged for clarity if complex. Explain the rationale behind architectural choices.
    - Core Mechanism(s): Detail the key technical innovations, algorithms, or processes that underpin the project. Explain *how* these mechanisms work and their significance. Code snippets or pseudo-code can be included for illustration if it aids understanding.
    - Smart Contracts (if applicable): List key smart contracts, link to them on a block explorer, and briefly explain their primary functions. Mention audit status and link to audit reports if available.

**4. Ecosystem & Use Cases:**
    - Target Audience: Describe the primary users or beneficiaries (e.g., Developers, DeFi Traders, NFT Collectors) and explain *why* and *how* the project caters to them.
    - How it's Used (Detailed Use Cases): Provide specific, illustrative examples of how users interact with the project. These should be step-by-step or scenario-based where appropriate to offer a clear understanding.
    - Integrations: List notable projects, platforms, or protocols it integrates with. Explain the nature and benefits of these integrations for users and the ecosystem.
    - Tokenomics (if applicable): If there's a native token, provide a detailed explanation of its utility within the ecosystem, its role in governance (if any), supply metrics (total, circulating, max), distribution model, and emission schedule. Link to the `[[Token Name]]` card.

**5. Getting Started & Resources:**
    - Accessing: Clear instructions on how to start using or interacting with the project/tool (e.g., web app URL, download links, API signup process).
    - Comprehensive Documentation: Link to official, detailed documentation.
    - Community Channels: Links to active official community channels (e.g., Discord, Telegram, Forum).
    - Support Resources: Links to official support channels, FAQs, or knowledge bases.
    - Source Code (if open source): Link to the primary code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), and mention the main license if known.

**6. Team and Project History:**
    - Team: Introduce the core team members or key contributors. Highlight their relevant experience, expertise, and past projects if publicly known and significant.
    - Project History & Milestones: Detail the project's development journey, including key milestones, significant achievements, major version releases, and any pivotal moments in its history. Outline future plans and long-term vision if available.

**7. Comparative Analysis (if applicable):**
    - Similar Projects: Identify key similar or competing projects. Provide a balanced and detailed comparison, highlighting similarities, differences, respective strengths, weaknesses, and unique selling points. This section should offer readers a clear understanding of the project's position in the market.

**8. Related Concepts:**
    - Links to relevant `explain-card`s (underlying technologies, e.g., Built using [[Optimistic Rollups]]).
    - Links to relevant `awesome-card`s (e.g., See [[Awesome DeFi Tools]]).

## General Guidelines Adherence

- **All formatting, linking, naming, and file location MUST adhere to the standards defined in the [`wiki-guide.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).** This includes using H2 for sections, prioritizing official external links, using appropriate internal links, balancing prose and lists, and placing the file in the `cards` directory.
- The card **MUST** start with the `#show-card` tag on the very first line.


> **Process and quality standards:**
> All content creation and review for show-cards must follow the 'Content Creation Checklist' and 'Final Review Checklist' sections in the [wiki-guide.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).
