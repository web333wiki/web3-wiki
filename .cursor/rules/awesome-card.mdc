# Awesome Card Rule

This rule defines the required content structure for an "awesome-card" in the Web3 Wiki, which curates a list of valuable resources related to a specific topic.

## Content Structure

```markdown
#awesome-card

## Introduction
- **Topic Focus:** Clearly state the specific topic this list covers (e.g., Awesome [[Zero-Knowledge Proofs]], Awesome [[Solidity]] Resources).
- **Purpose:** Explain *why* this curated list is useful (e.g., for developers learning X, for users exploring Y tools).
- **Scope:** Briefly define what kind of resources are included and excluded.

## Official Resources
- **Primary Website:** [Project/Concept Name Official Website Link] - Link to the main landing page.
- **Documentation:** [Link to Official Docs] - Describe what the documentation covers (e.g., API reference, getting started guide).
- **Whitepaper/Specifications:** [Link to Paper/Spec] - Briefly mention the core topic of the paper.

## Learning Materials
- **Tutorials:** [Link to Tutorial] - Specify skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and format (text, video).

- **Books:** [Book Title] by [Author] ([Link to buy/info]) - Add publication year and target audience.
- **Workshops/Guides:** [Link to Resource] - Describe the format and focus.

```

## General Guidelines Adherence

- **All formatting, linking, naming, and file location MUST adhere to the standards defined in the [`wiki-guide.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).** This includes using H2 for sections, prioritizing official external links with descriptive text, using relevant internal links, using bullet points for resource lists, and placing the file in the `cards` directory.
- The card **MUST** start with the `#awesome-card` tag on the very first line.
