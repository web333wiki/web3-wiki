# Awesome Card Rule

## Key Content Considerations

When creating or updating an `awesome-card`, ensure the following categories of resources are considered. The AI assistant should generate a logical content outline based on these key resource categories and the specific topic of the awesome list.

**1. Introduction:**
    - Topic Focus: Clearly state the specific topic (e.g., Awesome [[Zero-Knowledge Proofs]], Awesome [[Solidity]] Resources).
    - Purpose: Why this curated list is useful.
    - Scope: What kind of resources are included/excluded.

**2. Official Resources:**
    - Primary Website: Link to main landing page.
    - Documentation: Link to official docs (describe coverage).
    - Whitepaper/Specifications: Link to paper/spec (mention core topic).

**3. Learning Materials:**
    - Tutorials: Links with skill level and format.
    - Courses: Links with provider and key learning outcomes.
    - Books: Titles, authors, links (publication year, target audience).
    - Workshops/Guides: Links with format and focus.

**4. Development Tools (if applicable to the topic):**
    - SDKs/Libraries: Names, links (language/platform, function).
    - Frameworks: Names, links (problem solved/use case).
    - Testing Tools: Names, links (type of testing).
    - IDEs/Plugins: Names, links (IDE integration).

**5. Ecosystem & Community:**
    - Key Projects/Implementations: Links to `[[Project Card Name]]` or official sites.
    - Explorers: Names, links (e.g., Etherscan, Solscan).
    - Forums/Discussion: Links with primary focus.
    - Social Channels: Links with channel type (Discord, Twitter, etc.).

**6. Further Resources (Optional):**
    - Blogs/Articles: Links with author/publication and key topic.
    - Newsletters: Names, links (frequency, content focus).
    - Podcasts/Videos: Names, links (key hosts/topics covered).

## General Guidelines Adherence

- **All formatting, linking, naming, and file location MUST adhere to the standards defined in the [`wiki-guide.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).** This includes using H2 for sections, prioritizing official external links with descriptive text, using relevant internal links, using bullet points for resource lists, and placing the file in the `cards` directory.
- The card **MUST** start with the `#awesome-card` tag on the very first line.

> **Process and quality standards:**
> All content creation and review for awesome-cards must follow the 'Content Creation Checklist' and 'Final Review Checklist' sections in the [wiki-guide.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).
