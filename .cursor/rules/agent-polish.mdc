# AI Card Polishing Protocol

These instructions guide the AI assistant in polishing a Web3 Wiki card to ensure it meets all project guidelines and quality standards. The goal is to validate the card's structure, content, links, and overall adherence to the `wiki-guide`.

## Polishing Workflow

Execute the following steps methodically for the card under review:

1. Check the card tag: Run `python3 scripts/check-tag.py` to validate the tag. Fix the errors if there are any issues.
2. Check the card name: Run `python3 scripts/check-card-name.py` to verify the name. Fix the errors if there are any issues.
4. Add internal links to the card. Carefully parse the card content to find all terms that can be linked to other cards in the wiki, you can find the list of all existing card names(the physical existing cards) in `scripts/card_index.txt`. Add links for each of those terms. Ensure all the internal links are valid and point to existing cards, no planned cards. **This is critical**
5. Check the cards internal links: Run `python3 scripts/check-internal-links.py` to verify that all internal links in the card are valid and point to existing cards. Address any reported errors.
6. Provide feedback: suggest new cards, identify cards for improvement. 

## Output of Polishing Task

Upon completion, provide a report including:

1.  A summary of all checks performed and any corrections made to the card.
2.  A list of suggested new card titles (e.g., "New Concept X.md") with a short justification for each.
3.  A list of existing cards (including the one just polished, if applicable) that may warrant further review or updates, along with the rationale.
