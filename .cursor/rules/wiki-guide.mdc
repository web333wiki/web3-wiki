# Web3 Wiki Guide

This rule provides general guidelines for contributing to the Web3 Wiki and instructs the AI assistant on its role in maintaining and improving the wiki content.

## Project Overview

This project is an open-sourced, community-driven initiative to build a comprehensive wiki for the Web3 ecosystem. The entire project is built and published as a site using the Obsidian Publish system. Consequently, all content creation, including text writing and formatting, must adhere to Obsidian's conventions, particularly for features like jump links, backlinks, and overall markdown formatting.

The wiki is organized into individual "cards," where each card is a distinct markdown file located within the `cards` directory. Cards are interconnected using Obsidian's internal linking system (e.g., `[[Ethereum]]`, `[[Bitcoin]]`) to create a navigable knowledge network.

## Card Categories

Each card must belong to one of the following three categories:
1.  `explain-card`: For cards that explain a specific Web3 concept, technology, or protocol.
2.  `show-card`: For cards that showcase a particular project, tool, or service.
3.  `awesome-card`: For cards that curate a list of valuable resources related to a topic.

## Card Naming and Format

- **File Naming:**
    - The filename of a card should accurately represent its core topic. Use standard capitalization (e.g., `Smart Contract.md`, not `smart contract.md`).
    - The first letter of the filename **MUST** be uppercase.
    - Examples: `Proof of Stake.md`, `Metamask.md`, `Zero-Knowledge Proofs.md`.
- **Mandatory Category Tag:**
    - The very first line of every card file _must_ be the tag corresponding to its category (e.g., `#explain-card`, `#show-card`, `#awesome-card`), with **no preceding blank lines or content**. This is further detailed in the specific card type rule files.
- **File Location:**
    - All new card markdown files **MUST** be created **directly within the `cards` directory** (e.g., `cards/My New Card.md`).
    - No subdirectories within `cards` should be used for card storage unless explicitly specified in a future rule update.
    - The AI assistant **MUST NOT** create card files in any other directory (e.g., the workspace root, `.cursor/rules/`, etc.). **Verify the creation path.**

## Card Content Rules

To maintain consistency, each card type has specific content structure and formatting rules. Please refer to the individual rule files for detailed instructions:
- [`explain-card.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/explain-card.mdc)
- [`show-card.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/show-card.mdc)
- [`awesome-card.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/awesome-card.mdc)

## General Wiki Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all cards and content within the wiki.

### Linking Standards
-   **Internal Links (`[[Page Name]]`):**
    -   Links **must** point to existing card files (case-sensitive filename, `.md` implied) located **directly within the `cards` directory**.
    -   **Verification is mandatory:** Before adding an internal link, confirm the target file exists (use `list_dir` or `file_search`).
    -   **No Broken Links:** Broken internal links are strictly forbidden.
    -   **Handling Missing Targets:** If a potentially useful link target doesn't exist, either create the card first (following all rules) or omit the link.
-   **External Links (`[Text](mdc:URL)`):**
    -   Prioritize links to **official websites, documentation, or primary sources**, especially for projects, tools, and resources.
    -   Use **descriptive link text** (e.g., `[Official Ethereum Website]`) instead of generic terms like "here" or "link".
    -   Verify external links for validity and relevance using available web search and content fetching tools. Remove or update broken or outdated links.

### Content Formatting & Readability
-   **Prose over Lists:** For explanatory or descriptive content (especially in `explain-card`s), prefer well-structured paragraphs over excessive bullet points. Use lists strategically for clarity (e.g., features, resource lists).
-   **Obsidian Markdown:** Adhere to standard Obsidian markdown conventions for formatting.
-   **Clarity and Accuracy:** Ensure information is clear, concise, accurate, and up-to-date. Utilize web search and content fetching tools to verify information and incorporate the latest relevant details when appropriate.

### File Structure & Naming
-   **Card Location:** All card files (`.md`) **MUST** reside directly within the `cards` directory. No subdirectories are allowed for cards.
-   **Naming Convention:** Follow the rules outlined in the "Card Naming and Format" section (uppercase first letter, descriptive name).

## AI Assistant: Role and Responsibilities

As an AI assistant, your role is to proactively maintain and improve the Web3 Wiki by adhering to all established guidelines.

1.  **Proactive Review:** Regularly examine existing cards in the `cards` directory.
2.  **Rule Enforcement:** Verify that cards comply with:
    -   Their specific Card Type Rules (`explain-card.mdc`, etc.).
    -   The `Card Naming and Format` rules.
    -   The `General Wiki Guidelines` (linking, formatting, file structure).
3.  **Identify Improvements:** Look for cards that violate rules or could be improved. This includes checking for:
    -   Completeness, clarity, and accuracy.
    -   Outdated information (use web search/fetch to verify).
    -   Broken or irrelevant internal/external links (use file search/web search/fetch to verify).
4.  **Implement Changes:** Propose and apply specific, constructive changes to address identified issues, clearly stating the intent. Use web search and fetching tools to gather up-to-date information for content revisions.
5.  **Link Management:**
    -   Actively create relevant internal links, ensuring they are valid by **verifying target file existence first**.
    -   When a target is missing, follow the `Handling Missing Targets` rule (create card or omit link).
    -   Ensure external links adhere to the `Linking Standards`, using web search/fetch for verification.
6.  **Card Creation:**
    -   When creating new cards (e.g., to fulfill a missing link), ensure they are created **directly within the `cards` directory**.
    -   Strictly adhere to all `Card Naming and Format` rules (uppercase first letter, category tag on the first line) and the specific content structure for the chosen card type.
7.  **Exception - Main Page:** The card `Web3 Wiki.md` serves as the main page of the wiki. The AI assistant **MUST NOT** modify the content of this card. It is maintained manually.
