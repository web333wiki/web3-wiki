This project is an open-sourced, community-driven initiative to build a comprehensive wiki for the Web3 ecosystem. The entire project is built and published as a site using the Obsidian Publish system. Consequently, all content creation, including text writing and formatting, must adhere to Obsidian's conventions, particularly for features like jump links, backlinks, and overall markdown formatting.

The wiki is organized into individual "cards," where each card is a distinct markdown file located within the `cards` directory. Cards are interconnected using Obsidian's internal linking system (e.g., `[[Ethereum]]`, `[[Bitcoin]]`) to create a navigable knowledge network.

## Card Categories

Each card must belong to one of the following three categories:

1.  `explain-card`: For cards that explain a specific Web3 concept, technology, or protocol (e.g., `Hard fork.md`, `Rollup.md`).
2.  `show-card`: For cards that showcase a particular project, tool, or service (e.g., `So.ct of valuable resources related to a topic (e.g., `Awesome Ethereum.md`, `Awesome Polkadot.md`).

## Card Naming and Format

- **File Naming:**

  - The filename of a card should accurately represent its core topic.
  - The first letter of the filename must be uppercase.
  - Examples: `Proof of Stake.md`, `Metamask.md`.

- **Mandatory Category Tag:**
  - The very first line of every card file _must_ be the tag corresponding to its category. This tag helps in organizing and processing the cards.
  - The valid tags are:
    ```
    #explain-card
    ```
    ```
    #show-card
    ```
    ```
    #awesome-card
    ```

## Card Templates

To maintain consistency across all cards, templates are provided for each category. It is highly recommended to use these templates when creating new cards:

- [Template explain-card.md](mdc:cards/Template%20explain-card.md)
- [Template show-card.md](mdc:cards/Template%20show-card.md)
- [Template awesome-card.md](mdc:cards/Template%20awesome-card.md)
