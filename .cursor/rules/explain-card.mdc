## Content Structure

```markdown
#explain-card

## Introduction

- Why it's important in Web3
- Basic definition

## Core Concepts
- Key components or elements

## Related Concepts (Optional)

```

## Formatting Guidelines
- The card must start with the `#explain-card` tag on the first line.
- Use H2 (##) for main section titles (Introduction, Core Concepts, etc.).
- Use bullet points (-) for sub-items.
- Use Obsidian's internal linking format `[[Page Name]]` for backlinks to other cards.
- Ensure all information is accurate and clearly presented.
