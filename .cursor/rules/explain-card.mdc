# Explain Card Rule

This rule defines the required content structure for an "explain-card" in the Web3 Wiki.

## Content Structure

```markdown
#explain-card

## Introduction

- **What it is:** Start with a clear, concise definition of the concept, at least 2 sentences. It would be longer if it's a complex concept.
- **Analogy (Optional):** Use a simple analogy if it helps clarify the concept for beginners.
- **Importance/Purpose:** Explain *why* this concept exists and why it's significant, especially within the Web3 context.
- **Target Audience:** Briefly mention who this concept is most relevant to (e.g., developers, users, investors).

## Core Concepts

- **Key Components:** Break down the concept into its essential parts or elements. Explain each part clearly and deeply.
- **Mechanism/How it Works:** Describe the process or workflow involved. Use diagrams or flowcharts if helpful (describe them in text).
- **Technical Details:** Include relevant technical specifications, protocols, or algorithms. Explain technical details in a way that is easy to understand. 
- **Variations/Types (If applicable):** Mention different types or implementations of the concept if they exist (e.g., different types of consensus mechanisms for "Proof of Stake").

## Use Cases

- **Specific Examples:** Provide concrete examples of how this concept is used in real-world Web3 projects or scenarios. Link to relevant `show-card`s if available (e.g., [[Uniswap]] as an example of a DEX).
- **Benefits:** Detail the advantages or positive outcomes of using this concept.
- **Limitations/Challenges:** Discuss the drawbacks, risks, or challenges associated with the concept.
- **Comparison (Optional):** Briefly compare it to alternative concepts or traditional (Web 2.0) approaches if relevant.

## Related Concepts (Optional)
- **Prerequisites:** List any concepts the reader should understand before this one (e.g., [[Blockchain]] might be a prerequisite for [[Smart Contract]]).
- **Building Blocks:** Link to concepts that are components of this one.
- **Related Ideas:** Link to concepts that are similar, contrasting, or often discussed together.
- **Further Reading:** Link to more advanced concepts that build upon this one.
```

## General Guidelines Adherence

- **All formatting, linking, naming, and file location MUST adhere to the standards defined in the [`wiki-guide.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).** This includes using H2 for sections, appropriate use of prose vs. lists, correct internal/external linking, and placing the file in the `cards` directory.
- The card **MUST** start with the `#explain-card` tag on the very first line.
