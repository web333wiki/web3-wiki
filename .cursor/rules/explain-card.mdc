# Explain Card Rule

This rule defines the required content structure for an "explain-card" in the Web3 Wiki.

## Key Content Considerations

When creating or updating an `explain-card`, ensure the following aspects are covered. The AI assistant should generate a logical content outline based on these key elements and the specific nature of the concept being explained.

**1. Introduction:**
    - Clear and concise definition of the concept (at least 2 sentences, longer if complex).
    - Analogy (optional, to clarify for beginners).
    - Importance/Purpose: Why the concept exists and its significance in Web3.
    - Target Audience (e.g., developers, users, investors).

**2. Core Concepts & Mechanism:**
    - Key Components: Essential parts or elements, explained clearly and deeply.
    - Mechanism/How it Works: The process or workflow involved (diagrams can be described in text).
    - Technical Details: Relevant specifications, protocols, or algorithms, explained accessibly.
    - Variations/Types (if applicable): Different implementations or types of the concept.

**3. Use Cases & Implications:**
    - Specific Examples: Real-world Web3 project examples (link to `show-card`s if available).
    - Benefits: Advantages or positive outcomes.
    - Limitations/Challenges: Drawbacks, risks, or difficulties.
    - Comparison (optional): To alternative concepts or Web 2.0 approaches.

**4. Related Concepts (Optional but Recommended):**
    - Prerequisites: Concepts to understand first.
    - Building Blocks: Component concepts.
    - Related Ideas: Similar, contrasting, or co-discussed concepts.
    - Further Reading: Advanced concepts building upon this one.

## General Guidelines Adherence

- **All formatting, linking, naming, and file location MUST adhere to the standards defined in the [`wiki-guide.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).** This includes using H2 for sections, appropriate use of prose vs. lists, correct internal/external linking, and placing the file in the `cards` directory.
- The card **MUST** start with the `#explain-card` tag on the very first line.
