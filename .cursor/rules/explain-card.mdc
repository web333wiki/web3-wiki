# Explain Card Rule

## Key Content Considerations

When creating or updating an `explain-card`, ensure the following aspects are covered. The AI assistant should generate a logical content outline based on these key elements and the specific nature of the concept being explained.

**1. Introduction & Definition:**
    - Comprehensive Definition: Provide a clear, thorough, and nuanced definition of the concept. Go beyond a simple one-liner; explain its core meaning and context within Web3. This section should establish a solid foundational understanding.
    - Analogy/ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5): If the concept is complex, include a relatable analogy or a simplified explanation suitable for beginners to grasp the fundamental idea quickly. Ensure the analogy is accurate and helpful.
    - Importance & Purpose: Clearly articulate *why* this concept is important in the Web3 space. What problems does it solve, what capabilities does it enable, or what paradigm does it represent? Detail its significance and the reasons for its existence.
    - Target Audience & Relevance: Identify the primary audience(s) who would benefit from understanding this concept (e.g., developers, users, investors, researchers). Explain its relevance to each group.

**2. Core Principles & Detailed Mechanism:**
    - Key Components/Elements: Break down the concept into its essential constituent parts or elements. For each component, provide a detailed explanation of its function, characteristics, and how it contributes to the overall concept.
    - In-depth Mechanism/How it Works: Provide a step-by-step, thorough explanation of the process, workflow, or operational principles involved. If technical, explain the sequence of operations and interactions between components. Diagrams (described textually if necessary) should be used to clarify complex interactions or flows.
    - Underlying Technical Details: Delve into relevant technical specifications, protocols, algorithms, data structures, or mathematical foundations. Explain these in an accessible yet comprehensive manner, providing enough detail for a technical reader to gain a solid understanding. Reference primary sources or whitepapers where appropriate.
    - Variations, Types, or Implementations (if applicable): Discuss different existing or theoretical variations, classifications, or specific implementations of the concept. Highlight their differences, trade-offs, and specific use cases.

**3. Practical Applications, Use Cases & Implications:**
    - Concrete Examples & Real-World Applications: Provide specific, detailed examples of how this concept is used in real-world Web3 projects or scenarios. Link to relevant `show-card`s if they exist. The examples should clearly illustrate the concept in action.
    - Benefits & Advantages: Enumerate and elaborate on the advantages, positive outcomes, or improvements offered by this concept. Quantify benefits where possible or provide strong qualitative arguments.
    - Limitations, Challenges & Criticisms: Discuss any known drawbacks, risks, difficulties, scalability issues, security concerns, or common criticisms associated with the concept. Provide a balanced perspective.
    - Comparative Analysis (Optional but Encouraged): Compare and contrast the concept with alternative or similar concepts, or with traditional (e.g., Web 2.0) approaches. Highlight key differences in mechanism, efficiency, security, etc.

**4. Broader Context & Further Exploration (Optional but Recommended):**
    - Foundational Concepts/Prerequisites: List and briefly explain any foundational concepts that are essential for a deeper understanding of this topic. Link to their respective `explain-card`s.
    - Constituent Building Blocks: Identify if this concept is composed of other, more fundamental concepts. Explain how they combine and link to their `explain-card`s.
    - Related & Adjacent Ideas: Discuss other concepts that are closely related, often discussed in conjunction, or represent contrasting approaches. Link to relevant `explain-card`s.
    - Advanced Topics & Future Research: Suggest avenues for further learning, advanced topics building upon this concept, or open research questions and future development directions.

## General Guidelines Adherence

- **All formatting, linking, naming, and file location MUST adhere to the standards defined in the [`wiki-guide.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).** This includes using H2 for sections, appropriate use of prose vs. lists, correct internal/external linking, and placing the file in the `cards` directory.
- The card **MUST** start with the `#explain-card` tag on the very first line.

> **Process and quality standards:**
> All content creation and review for explain-cards must follow the 'Content Creation Checklist' and 'Final Review Checklist' sections in the [wiki-guide.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/wiki-guide.mdc).
